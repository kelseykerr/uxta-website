      This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used
      on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle
      your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our application. </div>
    <br>
    <div>What personal information do we collect from the people that use our app?</div>
    <br>
    <div> When signing up for the app, Uxta asks users to provide their name, email address, phone number, and address.</div>
    <br>
    <div> How do we use your information?</div>
    <br>
    <div> We use this information to: confirm you live in the community you wish to join, allow you to create new posts & offers, and to contact users when needed.</div>
    <br>
    <div>How do we protect your information?</div>
    <br>
    <div> Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive
      information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</div>
    <br>
    <div> Do we use 'cookies'?</div>
    <br>
    <div> We do not use cookies for tracking purposes. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different,
      look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. </div>
    <br>
    <div>Third-party disclosure</div>
    <br>
    <div> We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information. Third-party links Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party
      sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about
      these sites. Google Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</div>
    <br>
    <div>California Online Privacy Protection Act According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant
      page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above. You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:
    </div>
    <br>
    <div> • On our Privacy Policy Page </div>
    <br>
    <div>Can change your personal information: </div>
    <br>
    <div>• By signing into the app, navigating to the account tab, and editing your information </div>
    <br>
    <div> How does our site handle Do Not Track signals? </div>
    <br>
    <div>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. </div>
    <br>
    <div>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</div>
    <br>
    <div> It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
      Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's
      privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. Fair Information Practices The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they
      include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that
      protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email</div>
    <br>
    <div> • Within 7 business days </div>
    <br>
    <div>We will notify the users via in-app notification</div>
    <br>
    <div> • Within 7 business days </div>
    <br>
    <div>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
      have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors. CAN SPAM Act The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for
      commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</div>
    <br>
    <div> We collect your email address in order to:</div>
    <br>
    <div> • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</div>
    <br>
    <div> To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</div>
    <br>
    <div> • Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses. </div>
    <div>• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way. </div>
    <div>• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</div>
    <div>• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used. </div>
    <div>• Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly. </div>
    <div>• Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email. </div>
